DAGRAB - an audio cd grabber for linux.
(C) 1998,1999 Marcello Urbani <murbani@libero.it>

This version was patched by Ola Aronsson <ola@nollettnoll.net>
in order to cope with CDs containing data tracks; see 

dagrab.c_patch

for details, the changes made dagrab-0.3.4 -> dagrab-0.3.5-minified.

DAGRAB is a  program for reading audio tracks from a cdrom drive into wav
sound files.

It should work with any cdrom drive,provided that digital audio extraction 
is supported from both the drive and its linux driver, but is only tested
with IDE cdroms.

For an index of cdrom drives that supports digital audio extraction, 
take a look at these URLs:

<http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/~psyche/pc/cdrom/CDDA.html>

and

<http://www.anime.net/~goemon/linux-cd/cdda-list.html>

Many IDE/ATAPI drives supports it, but many don't.

This program is just a hack i wrote because i haven't found a similar program 
that worked good on my system.

I think the problem is that the linux ide-cd driver only reads 8 sectors a time,
so that any attempt to read more results in jitter inside the block.
This assumption is supported from the fact that cdda2wav worked good on my 
system if used with the option -n 8.Too bad, I only noticed it when my program 
was almost finished.
You can dramatically speed up audio extraction with both dagrab and cdda2wav
by patching your kernel setting CDROM_NBLOCKS_BUFFER to a higher value (32 seems
to be a good choice) and reading more sectors at a time.
NOTE: don't use sectors per request higher than CDROM_NBLOCKS_BUFFER unless you 
      own one of the few drives that don't require jitter correction.
Sometimes, it makes a few jitter correction errors/track, but i usually can't 
hear them in playback.

CDDB support is not well tested.

Please e-mail me if you notice a serious bug (I mean dangerous ones).
