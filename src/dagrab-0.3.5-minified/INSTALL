COMPILING AND INSTALLING DAGRAB

for linux 2.2.x, issuing the commands:

make 
make install

should do it; for older kernels you may need to edit the Makefile and
uncomment (i/e remove the # character) the line:

#UCD=-DUSE_UCDROM

before issuing the commands above.



Note: by default make install puts the binary in /usr/local/bin,wich might 
not be in your PATH variable, and so you will have to type

/usr/local/bin/dagrab

instead of only 

dagrab

you may fix this in several ways, the simplest is copying it by hand in a 
directory in your PATH, such as /usr/bin (you usually need to be root to 
put it there) or your private bin directory.
